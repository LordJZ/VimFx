# Handy standard Firefox features

One of VimFx’s key features is embracing standard Firefox features. That is
preferred over re-implementing similar functionality.

This section lists a few handy such standard features.


## The Address Bar

Firefox’s Address Bar is sometimes called the “Awesomebar” because it is so
powerful. Other than simply entering URLs, you can also use it to:

- Search through bookmarks.
- Search through history.
- Search through open tabs.
- Search using search engines.

Type a lone `*` to restrict the results to bookmarks only. Use `<c-enter>` to
open results in new tabs. There are [plenty more such tricks][location-bar].
